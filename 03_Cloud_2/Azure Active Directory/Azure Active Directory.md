It is important to understand these Azure AD concepts.

    Identity. An object that can get authenticated. An identity can be a user with a username and password. Identities also include applications or other servers that might require authentication through secret keys or certificates.

    Account. An identity that has data associated with it. You can't have an account without an identity.

    Azure AD Account. An identity created through Azure AD or another Microsoft cloud service, such as Microsoft 365. Identities are stored in Azure AD and accessible to your organization's cloud service subscriptions. This account is also sometimes called a Work or school account.

    Azure subscription. Used to pay for Azure cloud services. You can have many subscriptions and they're linked to a credit card.

    Azure tenant/directory. A dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD, a Tenant is automatically created when your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription.
        More instances of Azure AD can be created.
        Azure AD is the underlying product providing the identity service.
        The term Tenant means a single instance of Azure AD representing a single organization.
        The terms Tenant and Directory are often used interchangeably.
